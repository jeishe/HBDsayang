      <h2>Happy Birthday!</h2>
      <p>Dear Sheila Sayang aku,</p>
      i have many words to say but needless to say i 
      love you so much that i cannot show or express it
      towards you,I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how happy you make me feel.
      Being with you has brought so much light and joy into my life, and every day I find
      more reasons to love and appreciate you. From the little things you do to the way you
      make me smile, I truly feel so lucky to have you by my side. I hope you know how much you mean to me.
      Every moment we spend together, whether we’re just talking or sharing quiet times,
      reminds me how special you are. It’s in those simple moments that I realize how much
      better my life has become with you in it. I want you to know that I’m incredibly grateful for
      everything we have and everything we are building together. I hope we can keep this happiness,
      this closeness, and the love we share forever. </p>
      <p>With love, Jae</p>

      <h2>Sativa</h2>
      I believe that as long as we have each other, we can face
      anything that comes our way. Thank you for being you and for making me feel so loved.
      I hope we always stay this happy, and that our journey together continues to bring us closer every day. I know things have been tough lately, and I wish I could take away every worry and bit of stress you're feeling right now. But even though I can’t do that, I want you to know that I'm right here beside you, every step of the way. Remember, it’s okay to take a break and let yourself breathe. You don’t have to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders alone. We’re a team, and we’ll get through this together. </p>
      <p>With all my love, Jae</p>
